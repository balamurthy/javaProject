Hands on for Abstract class


Create a Abstract class called shape

colour - string

int area

In the constructor accept colour as a parameter and set it as the colour of the class

create an abstract method calcArea();

create a concrete method for setOuterColour(String colour);


//Define a child class rectangle that inherits from shape

int l,b,h

call calcarea(result of calculation of the area)



//Define a child class circle inheriting from shape

int circlearea = 22/7 *

constructor of circle should get the radius for circle area calculation

call calcarea (result of calculation of circle area)



//Runner class to create the rectangle object and print area of the rectangle
create the circle object and print area of the circle
